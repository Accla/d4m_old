# d4m
See the [Full D4M Readme here](d4m_api/README.txt).

Note this version of d4m does not include the external libraries--the `libext/` folder--needed to interface with Accumulo.
These external libraries are built from [d4m_api_java, to1.6 branch](https://github.com/Accla/d4m_api_java/tree/to1.6).

Libraries are [temporarily hosted here](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~dhutchis/D4M/index.html).
Follow instructions there to download and copy into d4m_api.
